# GitHub Copilot Python Feature Engineering Simple


Let's assume we have a dataset of house prices with the following columns: house_id, num_rooms, num_bathrooms, square_feet, year_built, and price. Use Python with the pandas library.


#Step-by-Step Plan:

- Load the dataset.
- Create new features:
	- age: The age of the house.
	- rooms_per_square_feet: The ratio of the number of rooms to the square footage.
	- bathrooms_per_square_feet: The ratio of the number of bathrooms to the square footage.
- Save the engineered dataset.
