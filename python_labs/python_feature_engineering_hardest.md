# GitHub Copilot Python Feature Engineering Hardest


Let's consider a more complex dataset, such as a dataset of customer transactions for an e-commerce platform. The dataset includes the following columns: customer_id, transaction_id, transaction_date, product_id, quantity, price, category, and payment_method.


#Step-by-Step Plan:

Step-by-Step Plan:
- Load the dataset.
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Create new features:
    - total_spent: The total amount spent by the customer.
    - transaction_month: The month of the transaction.
    - transaction_day: The day of the week of the transaction.
    - is_weekend: A binary feature indicating if the transaction occurred on a weekend.
    - quantity_per_transaction: The average quantity of items per transaction.
    - price_per_item: The average price per item.
- Create interaction features:
    - quantity_x_price: The product of the quantity and price.
- Aggregate features for each customer:
    - total_transactions: The total number of transactions per customer.
    - average_spent_per_transaction: The average amount spent per transaction by the customer.
    - most_common_category: The most frequently purchased category by the customer.
- Scale numerical features.
- Save the engineered dataset.
