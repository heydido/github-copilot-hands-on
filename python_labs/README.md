# GitHub Copilot Python Labs

We will be using a few small example Python scripts to practice with Copilot in different scenarios.

# Directions

Explain - [Python Explain Lab](https://github.com/GitHub-Admin-Customer-Repos/Copilot-Hands-On/blob/main/python_labs/python_explain.py)
- Use Copilot to explain the code contained in the python_explain.py file.  What does the dependency do?
- Use Copilot to try to simplify the code, as well as add documentation to explain what the code does.

Error Messaging - [Python Error Messaging Lab](https://github.com/GitHub-Admin-Customer-Repos/Copilot-Hands-On/blob/main/python_labs/python_error_messaging.py)
- Use Copilot to explain the error message that you should add before you run this code?
- Use Copilot to generate the error message that you should add to the code to handle this case.

Regex - [Python Regex Lab](https://github.com/GitHub-Admin-Customer-Repos/Copilot-Hands-On/blob/main/python_labs/python_regex.py)
- Given a log file with entries in the format:
    Extract the date, time, log level, module, and message from each log entry.
